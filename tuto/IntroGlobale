The vector itself indicates not only the direction of point B from A but also
can be used to find out the distance between A and B.
This is given by the length of a vector which can easily be computed with the following formula:

		  √‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
||V||=		 V.x∗V.x+V.y∗V.y+V.z∗V.z

A normalised vector (we will use normalise with a z here which is the standard in the industry),
is a vector whose length is 1 (vector B in figure 1).
Such a vector is also called a unit vector (it is a vector which has unit length)

The dot product or scalar product requires two vectors A and B and can be seen as the projection
of one vector onto the other. The result of the dot product is a real number (a float or double in programming).
A dot product between two vectors is denoted with the dot sign: A⋅B (it can also be sometimes written as <A,B>).
The dot product consists of multiplying each element of the A vector with its counterpart from
vector B and taking the sum of each product. In the case of 3D vectors (length of the vector is three,
they have three coefficients or elements which are x, y and z), it consists of the following operation:

A⋅B =A.x∗B.x+A.y∗B.y+A.z∗B.z

Note that this is quite similar to the way we compute the length (distance this time) of a vector.
If we take the square root of the dot product between two vectors that are equal (A=B),
then what we get is the length of the vector. We can write: ||V||2=V⋅V

The cross product is also an operation on two vectors,
but to the difference of the dot product which returns a number, the cross product returns a vector.
The particularity of this operation is that the vector resulting from the cross product is
perpendicular to the other two

Cosinus : permet d'obtenir la valeur en abscisse a partir de l'angle (si triangle rectangle)
Sinus : permet d'obtenir la valeur en ordonée a partir de l'angle (si triangle rectangle)

Si on connait l'angle et le rayon, alors on peut tracer le triangle (dans un cercle)
